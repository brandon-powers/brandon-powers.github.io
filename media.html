            <p>This is a video of Carl Sagan, an astrophysicist, explaining his idea of <em>the Pale Blue Dot</em>. This dot is Earth. Carl Sagan is one of the authors I like to read books from, and is very much so an inspiration. He studied the universe and brought science to the forefront of popular culture with his TV series <strong>Cosmos</strong>. I highly recommend anyone watch this series, which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc1NatQKSP0&list=PL_744YYIly5JyZC-H1Wj5dAM3Cjbdvoh1" target="_blank">here</a>. Another option is to read his book Cosmos, which was written alongside the series.</p>

            <p>I always thought if I didn't study Computer Science, the second most interesting thing to study would be Physics. Physics describes reality as it is, not as one hopes it to be. This man right here, Dr. Lawrence Krauss, started off as a particle physicist then went on to become a Cosmologist. He was one of the many that inspired me to appreciate science, both the body of knowledge and the methods and tools it deploys. I often like to listen to lectures while running or in my free time, and this is one of my favorites. If you're interested in reading some of his work, he has a great book talking about how it's very plausible that the Universe came from nothing, as opposed to the widespread belief that it required a Creator. It's called <em>A Universe From Nothing</em> which can be found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Universe-Nothing-There-Something-Rather/dp/1451624468" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p>As you can tell, this video is using the HTML5 video player. This differs from the above two videos, which are using YouTube embedded links, using their respective player. I'm a huge NASA fan, and I enjoy watching or reading about any new information they release. So this is an animation video of Earth rotating at night, and it's pretty cool. To go to the original link, and see other related videos as well, go <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/" target="_blank">here</a>. As a side note, everyone should love and support <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a>, they're awesome!</p>

            <p>Lastly, I had to include this Reddit AMA with Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, also an astrophysicist. He's the director of the Hayden Planetarium, which is part of the American Museum of Natural History. He was also taking the role of Carl Sagan in the recent reboot of Cosmos, and you can find the series on <strong>Netflix</strong>. He has written a number of books, most of which I've read and completely recommend. Long story short: this video showcases Neil's cosmic perspective, so you should watch.</p>

            <p>In this section, I'd like to showcase some of my favorite musicians and their music. I'd have to say that blues is probably my favorite genre of music. When I first started playing the guitar, blues is what drew me in.  Here are some of my favorite blues musicians and their music:</p>
            <h2>BB King</h2>

            <p>Along with blues music, I'm also a fan of jazz and rock music. More specifically, some of my favorite artists are: Miles Davis, Led Zeppelin, and John Mayer. Here they are:</p>
