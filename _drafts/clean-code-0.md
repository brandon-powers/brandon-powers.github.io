title: Clean Code: A Fragile Premise
---

```
...this book is based on a rather fragile premise: that good code matters.
```

These are the words of Kent Beck, arguably one of the the most insightful software engineers of our time. I'd like to briefly ponder this quote.

Does good code matter? How is good code defined? Who is to say a piece of code is good or bad--is that judgment affected by the point of reference and their biases or is it an objective standard?

That last question is quite interesting. For the sake of brevity, let us accept the premise that *good* code matters. If we took two software engineers, and had them review the "goodness" of the same piece of code, it's entirely possible they'd have wildly varying opinions. I imagine it going a bit like this:

Software engineer #1:

Software engineer #2:

Despite the subjectivity here, there must be some set of principles to rely on when reading or writing code with the goal of "goodness." For this, I'm going to defer to the classic, often-referenced Clean Code by the man himself, Uncle Bob. In chapter one, Uncle Bob lays out his opinion on the questions above.
