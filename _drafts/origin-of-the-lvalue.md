In 1967, before the advent of C and at a time when ALGOL was mainstream, a man named Christopher Strachey wrote a paper titled [Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages](https://brandon-powers.github.io/assets/Strachey-1967.pdf). Unknown to Strachey, this paper laid the groundwork for defining the semantics of a programming language that would later be used to create a whole 40+ years worth of new programming languages.

This article is about taking this technical paper Strachey wrote, and breaking it down to showcase his profound work. For anyone interested in programming languages, this a must-read.

### Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages

Christopher Strachey wrote a paper, in 1967, titled "Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages." This was during a time where ALGOL and PL/I were in the mainstream and C wasn't even invented. The key ideas in this paper live up to the name of being real, fundamental concepts in the design of C, C++, Java, you name it. This paper laid the groundwork for the discussion and defininition of programming languages. So who was Christopher Strachey?

#### Background

Christopher was a British Computer Scientist at a time.
