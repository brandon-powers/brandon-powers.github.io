            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img class="single_pic" src="images/brandonpowers.jpg" alt="Brandon Powers" />
            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Brandon Powers</strong>! I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Stonehill College. I have a ton of goals after I graduate, and a very clear career choice: I want to become a <strong>software engineer</strong>. The goal is to build something truly awesome, then do it all over again! I hope to be in the Boston, MA area and work for a company like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and the like. Most importantly, I want to contribute and be a part of a company that does great things. So why Computer Science?</p>
            <p>Computer Science is, in my opinion, truly expressive. That was the reason I started this journey of getting my B.S. in <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> (no pun intended). Think of any other field of study where you can literally create something one day that can affect millions of people the next. There aren't many, but Computer Science can do just that. Are you viewing this website on a laptop, a mobile phone, a tablet? Hardware engineers created the CPU running that device; software engineers programmed the operating system allowing you to use that hardware, and different software engineers created applications and a user interface to make that operating system accessible to a user. So when I think of why I study Computer Science, I can't help but be amazed at this opportunity to work on what is quite honestly the most ubiquitous invention ever made: computers.</p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="Baby Picture" />
            <img src="images/graduation.jpg" alt="Graduation" />
            <p>See that little guy to the left? Yeah, <strong>that's me</strong>. I was a funny looking baby, a little chubby too. I was born on March 24, 1995, and I'm the youngest in the family. I have three brothers and one sister, so there's five of us. In order of age, my siblings names are: Jimmy, Tyler, Stephanie, Dylan, and Brandon (that's me). I grew up in Randolph, Massachusetts and as much as everyone complains about their hometown, I wouldn't change anything about my childhood. I went through Randolph schools from going to preschool at Here-We-Grow next to the Fire Department all the way to graduating from Randolph High School, in the picture to the right. </p>
            <p>One of my favorite memories was playing with my brothers and my neighbors Dan and Jer. We would play basketball outside, make up dinosaur games, and so much more. There was one game where we would make bow and arrows out of sticks in the woods, build bases and attack each others base, shooting small sticks as arrows and running around like crazy. Then we would go inside and play some video games on our old fashion GameCube or Playstation 1. <abbr title="Too long; Didn't Read">TL;DR:</abbr> I had a lot of fun with my brothers and neighbors as a kid.</p>
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <img src="images/running.jpg" alt="Running" />
            <img src="images/horror.jpeg" alt="Horror Movie" />
            <p>I know what you're thinking: why is there a hidden face in the blood? Well, I couldn't tell ya. But I can tell you that I love watching <strong>horror movies</strong>, and Sinister is one of my favorites. I'm not sure what it is about them: the scary music, the crazy twists, or the gruesome parts. I've always liked horror movies; so much so that I used to watch all of the Scream movies with the old lady across the street on VHS. What can I say, I was an interesting kid.</p>
            <p>Another interest of mine started in high school, when I began <strong>running</strong>. The thing I enjoy about running is that it's empowering. It makes you feel strong and alive. You can just run, look around, and think freely. Not to mention the health benefits. I started running Cross Country as a sophomore in high school, then went on to running track and field as well. I focused on distance running, mainly the mile and two mile events. I did that for a good amount of time throughout high school, missing some seasons and running others. At the moment, I don't run competitively or for a team; I run for the sake of running. </p>
            <p>Last but not least, I like to <strong>read</strong>! It's calming, and allows you to keep on learning new things. I like to read books on science, nutrition, productivity, and other subjects alike. Some of my favorite books are: Cosmos by Carl Sagan, Death by Black Hole by Neil deGrasse Tyson, and The China Study by Dr. Colin Campbell. I'm currently reading The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt & Dave Thomas, which I'm almost done with, and I'm loving it. </p>

            </ol>
            <p>I'm currently in my Spring Semester as a junior here at Stonehill, and I'm taking the above classes. I'm quite excited for this semester because of all that I'll be learning in these courses. I think the class I'm most excited for is <em>Advanced Programming</em> because I'll be learning about software engineering and the web. As you remember from above: software engineering is where I'm hoping to be, so the more I learn, the better.</p>
