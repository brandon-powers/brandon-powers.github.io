<p>Lying is not generally a virtue. Though it is common for people to tell lies as a part of everyday life. Why, if we know it is the case that it often causes suffering to yourself and others?</p>

<p>Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author, explores this question with a proposition to <em>never tell a lie</em>, in his book <a href="https://samharris.org/books/lying/">Lying</a>. It’s based on a moral seminar he had taken in undergraduate, and this is my second read of it so far.</p>
