            <p>In this section, I thought I'd share some interesting links to websites I go to often. To be honest, I think I'll even put down links I just find interesting for the sake of being interesting!

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow" src="images/reddit.png" alt="Reddit" /></a>
            <p>Reddit is pretty awesome. It's probably best described as a forum, where people go to post and discuss different topics. Under the umbrella called Reddit, there are subreddits which are their own self-contained forums about a particular topic, and they can have their own rules of discussion. I like to go through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny" target="_blank">/r/funny</a> subreddit or the home page most of the time. Just a heads up: TL;DR means "Too long; Didn't read." If you check out Reddit, you might see that a lot.</p>
            <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow" src="images/stackoverflow.png" alt="Stack Overflow" /></a>
            <p>Stack Overflow is a community of programmers, answering each others questions about all kinds of different topics. I use Stack Overflow whenever I have a question about some error, want to read an opinion on some programming idea, or any other programming related things. If you Google a programming question, you're more likely than not to see Stack Overflow as your first result. And if you do, go there! I can't even begin to tell you how much it has helped when I've been stumped on some random problem that I have no idea how to solve. Also, credits to whoever came up with the idea of using the name "Stack Overflow."</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow" src="images/youtube.png" alt="YouTube" /></a>
            <p>YouTube is a place to share videos, plain and simple. YouTube has literally any type of video you'd want to find, and plenty more that you probably <em>wouldn't</em> want to find. I watch way too many YouTube videos, and I'm sure some of you reading this can say the same. Whether it's a cat video, or you got caught up watching the videos in the sidebar and dug yourself into some weird section of YouTube, it happens. Anyway, YouTube isn't going anywhere and I'm sure I'll be watching videos on it for a long time.</p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow" src="images/google.gif" alt="Google" /></a>
            <p>Google is the most efficient, widely used search engine there is, period. It's hard to argue with such a statement, despite the fact that it's an opinion. If you need to find anything, you go to Google. The prevalence of Google is so strong that the word "google" has become a verb: just google it. Everyone loves Google because it has all the answers you'll need. This is the site I probably use the most, to be quite honest.</p>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow" src="images/netflix.png" alt="Netflix" /></a>
            <p>Netflix is the streaming site that brings a ton of tv shows, movies, and documentaries right to your screen, for a small cost of like ten bucks a day. The amount of content you get for that money is well worth it, and in the first week, I'm sure you'll get your moneys worth. Netflix is my go to site to watch movies, or guiltfully binge watch TV shows. I'm on season 7 of X-Files, and I'm on my way to the finish. If you're wondering: yes, absolutely. You should watch the X-Files. The truth is out there. The question is: do you want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files" target="_blank">believe?</a></p>
            <a href="https://www.quora.com/topic/Software-Engineering" target="_blank"><img class="noshadow" src="images/quora.png" alt="Quora" /></a>
            <p>Quora is like Stack Overflow, in that it's a forum that can be used to ask questions about programming and software. It's different in the sense that it's a more general forum, where you can ask questions about almost anything. I tend to read questions from the software engineering section, which is linked above. The questions are always interesting and informative, some of which solve the problems I couldn't find on Stack Overflow.</p>
