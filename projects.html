        <h3>Py-shell</h3>
        <p class="skills">Python</p>
        <p>Py-shell is a <strong>bash shell emulator</strong> written in Python. It only implements a subset of the shell commands -- it's not a full blown emulator. The goal of py-shell was to demonstrate the scripting capabilities of the language and its standard library. It used modules like <em>shutil</em> and <em>os</em> which were extremely useful in implementing these commands.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of this project was to write an <strong>in-depth research paper</strong> on the Python programming language. It covers a breadth of topics about the implementation of the language and its use. It's about 30 pages long, so feel free to skip sections. The paper is up on GitHub along with the source code below.</p>

        <h3>simple-ftp</h3>
        <p class="skills">C++, gdb, valgrind</p>
        <p>I call this project 'simple-ftp' because it's an <strong>implementation of a simple file transfer protocol</strong>, supporting commands like get, put, and delete. First, I created the protocol used for the transfer of files and commands in a text file, then implemented them in C++. </p>
        <p>This project was important for me because it allowed me to take it through the many stages of software development. It went from a <em>problem specification</em>, to a <em>design</em> of a solution and protocol, to the <em>implementation</em> of that solution. It made me think about tradeoffs of doing one thing over the other, and the effect it would have on the final project. I also had to use the utilities <strong>gdb</strong> and <strong>valgrind</strong>; gdb for debugging + segmentatition faults and valgrind for memory leaks.</p>
        <p>On a final note, if you're interested in using this application, the client is compatible on both a Linux and OS X system, while the server is only compatible on a Linux system.</p>

        <h3>brandon-powers.github.io</h3>
        <p class="skills">HTML, CSS, Jekyll, GitHub Pages</p>
        <p>This website was created with the goal of being <strong>as simple as possible</strong>. For that reason, I used HTML and CSS to write the markup and Jekyll to build the site. I found Jekyll to be such a useful tool in that it gives you clean URL's, includes, Liquid template processing, etc. all with the performance benefits of static content with no backend. Lastly, I'm hosting this website on GitHub Pages with <em>enforced https</em>, which is really awesome.</p>
