Hi there, I'm Brandon.

I enjoy writing articles about what I'm working on, or what I'm thinking about at a particular moment in time. My primary interests are Computer Science related fields, be it software engineering, computer networking, cybersecurity, etc.. I also like [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

I'm currently a Software Engineer at [ListenFirst](https://www.listenfirstmedia.com/) in New York City. A few of the things I work on:

1. integrating external data sources with our data ingestion system
  - i.e. write ingest handler to integrate a new audience insights provider for multiple channels (Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, etc.)
2. data modeling in our operational data store or data warehouse
3. writing API endpoints to expose a particular resource or allow access to specific collections of data
4. satisfy data pull requests from product/client services (i.e. retrieve all of the Instagram pages in our data store actively associated with a set of brands that are owned by audience-enabled accounts)
4. changing the world one line of code at a time

Okay, number four was a slight exaggeration, but I'd like it to be true.

Feel free to check me out or shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonkpowers/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/brandon-powers).
