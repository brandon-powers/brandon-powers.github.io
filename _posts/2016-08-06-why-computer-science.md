title: "Why Computer Science?"

> Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "what is." Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to."

This quote by Harold Abelson beautifully answers the question, "Why Computer Science?" You might be wondering how so. This idea that computation deals with the **how to** do things as opposed to what things are, is the reason the next sentence is true. _Since its inception, Computer Science has undeniably changed the world_. 

#### Alan Turing & The Moon

In 1936, when Alan Turing wrote the groundbreaking paper, "On Computable Numbers, With An Application To The Entscheidungsproblem," he laid the foundation for a Turing machine. A few decades later, hardware engineers started to build machines using these fundamental ideas of Computer Science. Software engineers began to build applications using the assembly language of their machine. Higher level programming languages were being designed, implemented, and improved upon concurrently with the hardware of these machines being optimized. At this point, it's the year 1969, and Computer Science has already begun to make an impact on the world. It's at this moment that Computer Scientists wrote the software that enabled us to step foot on the Moon. 

> We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done. 

In 1936, Turing surely had no idea that his work would contribute to us landing on the Moon, because _he could only see a short distance ahead_. I feel like his sentiment in the above quote is as applicable to Computer Science today as it has ever been.

#### Catalyst for Change

Fast forward a few decades, and the **how to** of Computer Science built this thing called the Internet. From the hardware infrastructure, to the low level networking protocols that were developed and implemented, to the application layer programs like web browsers, the Internet is a direct product of the innovations and progress that Computer Science has made. And we all know how much the Internet has contributed to us as a species. 

The point I'm trying to make is that the **how to** of Computer Science is a **catalyst for change**; someone can write a web application one day that will reach millions of people all around the world the next, and make their lives better. So the reason I choose to study Computer Science is because _computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to"_ and I cannot think of a better way to change the world than that.
