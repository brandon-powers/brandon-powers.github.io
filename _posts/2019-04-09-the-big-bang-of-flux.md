title: The Big Bang of flux
---

This blog is named *flux*.

Consistent writing on topics I find interesting or useful is the intent. The goal is to write mostly about technical topics in Computer Science related fields, although that won't be a limiting factor.

### Why *flux*?

Continuous change.

That's what comes to mind when I hear the word flux. It's one of the few constants in life, as things will always be changing. I feel it's important to learn how to adapt to this change, as stagnation is a dangerous state that lends itself to quiet degradation.
