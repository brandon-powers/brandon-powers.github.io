title: The Big Bang of flux
---

This blog is named *flux*.

### Why?

I thought it sounded cool. Also, Michael Faraday and magnetic flux is fascinating. Bonus points if you recognized the partial quote in the header.

### Goals

I've set a few goals for this blog:

* Write an article once per week, and release it on Sunday morning

Okay, I only set one, but for good reason. I don't want to set any limits or restrictions besides consistent writing on topics I find interesting or useful to others. The first article coming up will be about executing raw SQL statements in a Ruby on Rails project, so stay tuned!

Thanks for the read, I hope you enjoyed.
