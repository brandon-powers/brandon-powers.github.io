> "<Sam Harris Lying quote>"

Lying is not generally a virtue. Though it is common for people to tell lies as a part of everyday life. Why, if we know it is the case that it often causes suffering to yourself and others?

Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author, explores this question with a proposition to _never tell a lie_, in his book [Lying][Lying-Book]. It's based on a moral seminar he had taken in undergraduate, and this is my second read of it so far.
