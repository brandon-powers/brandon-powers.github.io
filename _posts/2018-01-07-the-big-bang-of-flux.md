title: The Big Bang of flux
---

This blog is named *flux*.

I've set only one goal for this blog:

* Write and release at least one article per week

Consistent writing on topics I find interesting or useful is the intent, which is why there aren't any other restrictions or rules. The goal is to write mostly about technical topics in Computer Science related fields, although that won't be a limiting factor.

### Why *flux*?

Continuous change. That's what comes to mind when I hear the word flux. It's one of the few constants in life, as things will always be changing. I feel it's important to learn how to adapt and grow as things change, as stagnation is a dangerous state that lends itself to quiet degradation.

An auxiliary reason was that I find magnetic flux to be fascinating.

The first article this upcoming Sunday will be about executing raw SQL statements in a Ruby on Rails project, so stay tuned!
