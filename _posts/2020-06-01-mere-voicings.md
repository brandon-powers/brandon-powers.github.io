# Mere Voicings

The concept of a "*voicing*" is a useful one. I like to think of it as an arrangement of notes being played in a specific way.

For example, a C major chord consists of the notes C-E-G. Suppose on the guitar, I play the open position C shape and the barre chord C shape (root on the E, 8th fret). In both instances, a C major chord is being played, the difference is in the way they're played: one uses a lower pitch, the other uses a higher pitch.

These shapes are considered two different voicings of the same underlying chord. That's the key idea behind what a *voicing* is: **an instance of fundamental blueprint**, which in this case, is the major chore formula with C as the root note (1-3-5).

To those with a background in programming or CS: the chord shapes are like objects, while the formula is like a class -- they're instances of a formula just like objects are instances of a class.
