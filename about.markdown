Hello there, my name is Brandon.

In 2017, I received an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, studying everything from abstract data types to cache locality. I moved to New York City a week later, and began working as a software engineer (SE) at a social media analytics company, ListenFirst Media. I spent about the next two years working on data ingestion, transformation, and access while at ListenFirst (LF). That experience shaped me as an engineer, and I'm forever grateful to the people who contributed: Mike & Ben for the opportunity to join LF, Tony for being a mentor and leader of the ingest team we were a part of, Onel, Dmitriy, Pawel, both (C/K)hrises, and everyone else I had the pleasure to learn from.

In February 2019, I moved back home to MA. My second nephew had recently been born and I had been undergoing a series of health issues that caused me to take some time off. After a couple of months and a non-trivial level of personal adversity, I began working at Teikametrics, an e-commerce AI company, as an SE II on the infrastructure team. My experience at Teika was filled with challenges: learning Scala, learning the principles and practices of a functional programming (FP) style, and then learning the ecosystem of Scala FP tools that enable the combination of the two to be productive and robust. We emphasized immutable data, pure functions, and a "tagless final" style that allowed us to write extensible abstractions. I had a teammate and mentor, Gavin, that deserves most of the credit for the amount of learning I underwent at Teika: both for learning how to program in a FP-style and how to design systems from scratch.

In February 2020, I left Teikametrics and took a professional step back. After considering my next steps, and adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to look for new opportunities that aligned with my vision for the next 1, 3, or 5 years.

This leads me to June 2020, where I will be joining <TODO: fill in on start date>.
