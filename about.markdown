Hello there, my name is Brandon.

In 2017, I received an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, studying everything from abstract data types to cache locality, while learning to function well as a part of a software engineering team with non-technical stakeholders.

Soon after, I moved from the Boston, MA area to NYC and began a job as a software engineer at ListenFirst Media, primarily on the data ingestion team. I spent from June 2017 to February 2019 at ListenFirst, of which I learned a lot and improved my ability to perform as a professional software engineer. I'm grateful for the experience, and the team.
